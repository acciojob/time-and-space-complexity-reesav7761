    <h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer, our goal should be to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient.</p>
		<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For example, if a program takes an array of size n as a input, the space comlexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
